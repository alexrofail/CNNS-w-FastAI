# CNNS-w-FastAI

A basic tutorial of convolutional neural networks using the Fast.ai API and PyTorch modules. We use the MNIST_Samples dataset initially and then use a PETS dataset to talk about extending to color images before using the full MNIST dataset to train a CNN (with BatchNorm layers) to 99% accuracy.
